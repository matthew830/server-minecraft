	"description": "Upkeep, like Ordnance, is a remnant of the technology of a war fought in ancient times come to life. Puppeteered by insects, spirits or similar other means, it has been reactivated in a time where fuel sources are abundant once again, where it follows and supports Ordnance and other origins with its piercing armaments and transport oriented abilities."
