	"description": "Engineer is an autonomous repair and logistics support construct, a remnant of the technology of a war fought in ancient times come to life. Puppeteered by insects, spirits or similar other means, it has been reactivated in a time where fuel sources are abundant once again, where it builds and maintains bases and other constructs like Iron Golems, Ordnance or Upkeep."
