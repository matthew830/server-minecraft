	"description": "Trerror is a large, treaded ground-based construct with a heavy frame and armed with both an artillery cannon and a machine gun. While fast on flat ground, it struggles moving around jagged terrain, but the power and spammability of its main weapons make it a force to be reckoned with. Just like Ordnance, Upkeep and Engineer, Trerror is a remnant of the technology of a war fought in ancient times come to life. Puppeteered by insects, spirits or similar other means, it has been reactivated in a time where fuel sources are abundant once again."
